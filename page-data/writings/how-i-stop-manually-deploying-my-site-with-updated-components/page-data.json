Soon I found that it was <BoldText>SO STUPID</BoldText> to manually run the deploy command every single time I commit new changes to the site. That's why I seek help from <HyperLinkText href={`https://circleci.com/`}>Circle CI</HyperLinkText>.</NormalText><Header>So what is CI / CD ????</Header><Image src=\"/cicd/cicd-pipeline.png\" alt=\"cicd-pipeline\" /><NormalText><BoldText>CI</BoldText> stands for <BoldText>Continuous Integration</BoldText>. So if I have set up a CI environment for my website, I can ensure the whole project will be built in the same environment and with the same versions of packages whenever I commited my code from anywhere. This can avoid the compatability issue of the update I made with the existing code base. Also, I can setup some tests for my commits acting as a second barrier before actually deploying.</NormalText><NormalText><BoldText>CD</BoldText> stands for <BoldText>Continuous Deployment</BoldText>. As you can tell from the words, it just means the server will help you in automatically deploying after all those checking and building in the above steps.</NormalText><Header>How do I make use of Circle CI ?</Header><NormalText>So basically I wrote a <BoldText>config.yml</BoldText> file under root folder <BoldText>.circleci</BoldText>.</NormalText><Code language=\"yaml\">{`# Version of CircleCI\nversion: 2.1\n\njobs:\t\n# Name of the job\t\n\tdeploy-site:\n\t\t# Tell CircleCI that I need docker environment\n\t\tdocker:\n\t\t\t# Specify the image I need\n\t\t\t- image: circleci/node:latest\n\n\t\tworking_directory: ~/my-portfolio\n\n\t\tsteps:\n\t\t\t- checkout\n\n\t\t\t- run: sudo npm install -g gh-pages\n\n\t\t\t# Download and cache dependencies to avoid installing package per commit\n\t\t\t- restore_cache:\n\t\t\t\tkeys:\n\t\t\t\t- dependencies-{{ checksum \"package.json\" }}\n\t\t\t\t# Fallback to using the latest cache if no exact match is found \n\t\t\t\t- dependencies-\n\n\t\t\t- run: yarn install\n\n\t\t\t- save_cache:\n\t\t\t\tpaths:\n\t\t\t\t\t- node_modules\n\t\t\t\tkey: dependencies-{{ checksum \"package.json\" }}\n\n\t\t\t- run: yarn run build\n\n\t\t\t- run: git config --global user.email chrisliupascal@gmail.com\n\n\t\t\t- run: git config --global user.name nighostchris\n\n\t\t\t- run: yarn run deploy\nworkflows:\n\tmain:\n\t\tjobs:\n\t\t\t- deploy-site\n\ngeneral:\n\tbranches:\n\t\tonly:\n\t\t\t- dev`}</Code><NormalText>I wrote the above .yml by reading some <HyperLinkText href={`https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#section=configuration`}>documentation</HyperLinkText> in Circle CI.</NormalText><Image src=\"/cicd/circle-doc-1.png\" alt=\"circle-doc-1\" /><Image src=\"/cicd/circle-doc-2.png\" alt=\"circle-doc-2\" /><NormalText>And then I go to CircleCI...</NormalText><NormalText>Register an account...</NormalText><NormalText>Link CircleCI with my Github and push my code</NormalText><NormalText>See if the config works...</NormalText><Image src=\"/cicd/circle-github-auth.png\" alt=\"circle-github-auth\" /><NormalText>The reason of the error is that CircleCI needs a <BoldText>deploy key with greater priviledge</BoldText>, which is <BoldText>write access</BoldText> to repository in this case, to deploy the updated built site.
