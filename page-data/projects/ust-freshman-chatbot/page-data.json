That's the first time I need to learn new framework in a pretty short time and implement the features from scratch. At last we got quite a number of expected features done despite the stone-age like standard IO interface restricted by LINE. Users can ask about the bus ETA, contact information of departments staffs and even rough estimation of time to go from one place to another within campus.","type":"Chatbot","screenshots":[{"src":"/chatbot/bus.png","alt":"campus-bus"},{"src":"/chatbot/campus-eta.png","alt":"chatbot-campus-eta"},{"src":"/chatbot/recreation.png","alt":"chatbot-recreation"},{"src":"/chatbot/societies.png","alt":"chatbot-societies"},{"src":"/chatbot/staff.png","alt":"chatbot-staff"},{"src":"/chatbot/uml-diagram.jpg","alt":"chatbot-uml-diagram"}],"lnl":"Java, Spring, PostgreSQL","srcLink":["https://github.com/nighostchris/ust-freshman-chatbot","Github Repository"]}}]}},"pageContext":{"projectId":"5392a0b4-3f4e-5581-b16e-d78ef775c42a"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
