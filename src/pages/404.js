      One of the questions, which rise in search for a good template is what is React.js.
      This technology was developed by Jordan Walke and is an open-source JavaScript library
       for creating user interfaces for applications, which use one single page. First React was applied in 
       2011 on Facebook newsfeed and in 2012 on Instagram, so you definitely have seen pages made with React.
    </NormalText>
  </>
)

export default NotFoundPage
