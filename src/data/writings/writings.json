I am just writing this passage to record how I learn and try mobile app development. My views and comments could probably be VERY WRONG XD.</BoldText></NormalText><NormalText>So actually I have been quite interested in experiencing mobile app development for few years but I still haven't try it out when I am writing this paragraph LOL. From my understanding, the current trend of mobile app development can be seperated into 2 parts, <BoldText>native</BoldText> and <BoldText>cross-platform</BoldText>.</NormalText><Breakline /><Header>Native</Header><NormalText>Native means coding a mobile app by a specific language that targets to run on certain operating system. For example, <BoldText>Java</BoldText> and <BoldText>Kotlin</BoldText> for Android platform, <BoldText>Objective C</BoldText> and <BoldText>Swift</BoldText> for IOS platform. Since I am going to dig into IOS platform, I won't be exploring Java and Kotlin here.</NormalText><Image src=\"/ios/swift-vs-objective-c.jpg\" alt=\"swift-vs-objective-c\" /><NormalText>I found out there is quite an interesting story behind Objective-C.</NormalText><BulletList listItems={[\"In 1986, the inventors of Objective-C published a book about the design concept of the language, which marked the birth of Objective-C.\", \"Steve Jobs was abandoned by Apple and he founded another company called NeXT. NeXT bought the copyright of Objective-C in 1988 for developing AppKit and FoundationKit.\", \"Apple absorbed NeXT in late 1991 and Steve Jobs become CEO of Apple again.\", \"And probably you now understand how Objective-C became foundation of OS X. But obviously it is VERY OLD already and that's why Swift comes in.\"]}></BulletList><Breakline /><NormalText><BoldText>Swift</BoldText> was firstly introduced to public in 2014 WWDC(Apple Worldwide Developers Conference). Apple described the language as <BoldText>Modern, Interactive, Safe, Fast and Powerful</BoldText>. The version of Swift latest release is 5.2.2 already comparing to 1.0 in September 4, 2014. Seems I can conclude that Apple will continue to support the growth of this language and slowly replace Objective-C by looking at the continuous and stable update of the language over the past few years. So the next question would be, <BoldText>how good is Swift ?</BoldText></NormalText><NumberedList listItems={[\"Co-existance of Swift and Objective-C in the same project is just like C and C++. Developers can integrate them easily and freely.\", \"Swift supports cross-platform development for the Apple ecosystem, like iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac.\", \"Objective-C requires manual memory management and performs badly. Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting to manage memory, which in simpler words, means utilizing resources to the most efficient extent by auto memory management and eliminate those severe leakages and flaws.\", \"Swift uses simpler, cleaner and easier understandable syntax like Python.\", \"Speed performance was once a big issue and concern for Swift, but Apple is gradually carrying out optimization and improvement during update.\"]}></NumberedList><NormalText><BoldText>Errr...</BoldText> I can't think of a reason for myself to not learning Swift as a beginning to iOS development LOL. Before jumping into Swift, let's slightly investigate <BoldText>Cross-Platform</BoldText> development as well.</NormalText><Breakline /><Header>Cross-Platform</Header><NormalText>The main idea is just <BoldText>\"Write once, Use everywhere\"</BoldText>, which is what <BoldText>React Native says </BoldText> as well. When the target audience of your product are everyone that equipped with a cellphone, then probably you don't want to implement the same application flow in many different lanugages in order to support different platforms. In this case, cross-platform developing tools will suit you the best.</NormalText><Image src=\"/ios/react-native.png\" alt=\"react-native\" /><NormalText><BoldText>React Native</BoldText> was first released in March 2015. It allows developers to build Android and iOS apps in the same time with the help of <BoldText>Javascript</BoldText> and one of it's best UI framework <BoldText>React</BoldText>. As you can tell, it is promoting a React ecosystem that enables developers to use the same skill sets in both web and mobile app development. It greatly smoothen the learning curve for those programmers with web dev experience or even React foundation. Few years ago I have played around React Native for some time but the experience is not that good. There are bugs and performance issues but I am not sure what the current version looks like. You know things can improve a lot in few years.</NormalText><Breakline /><Image src=\"/ios/flutter.jpg\" alt=\"flutter\" /><NormalText>React Native is a product from <BoldText>Facebook</BoldText> while <BoldText>Flutter</BoldText> is supported by <BoldText>Google</BoldText>. Flutter was introduced to public in <BoldText>Google I/O 2017</BoldText> and released in 2018. It is a pretty new framework comparing to other cross-platform options. It has a pretty good performance due to the underlying <BoldText>Dart</BoldText> compiler and the direct communication between the platform and code. It does not need a bridge as middleman to communicate with system while React Native relys on Javascript. Flutter got a great future potential but just keep a certain distance from it first. You know Google likes to abort their projects suddenly in one day. Who knows XD. It certainly still needs some time to be mature.</NormalText><Breakline /><NormalText><BoldText>Alright... time for me to dig deeper into Swift. I will update my learning progress when I have time. See you next time :P</BoldText></NormalText>"
